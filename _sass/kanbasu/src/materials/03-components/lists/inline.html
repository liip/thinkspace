notes: |
  Put list items inline with or without gutters. You can reduce or increase the space by using the modifiers `tiny`, `small`, `large` or `huge`. Remove gutters with `tight`, add separators with `divided`.

  Since the list items are displayed as `inline-block`, you will probablby get an extra white space between them. Kanbasu was first removing those by setting the `font-size` to zero but this will prevent your code from being DRY in many cases. Therefor you should handle that on your side the way your prefer. [This article](https://css-tricks.com/fighting-the-space-between-inline-block-elements/) covers the topic pretty well.
